# WorldKitchen
An app developed in java for android. A cookbook with recipes from around the world and that adjusts ingredients to the amount of people served.

Due to the size of the Android Studio Project, I could not upload the entire project, so I have just uploaded the most important files that were used to create the app.

I was personally responsible for writing the code regarding the adjustment of the recipes, organizing the UI, and the movement between screens.
